# Yoga Web App

This web app is a **Yoga Batch Registartion Form** created as part of an internship assignment at Flexmoney. Users can register for yoga classes using this application. The project is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). Throughout the development process, I gained valuable experience in form validation, connecting the frontend to the backend, and deploying the web app online.

## Project Overview

1. **Frontend Development:**
   - Created a responsive admission form using HTML, CSS, Javascript and ReactJS.
   - Ensured the form's responsiveness across various devices.

2. **Backend Development:**
   - Implemented the backend using Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB.
   - Conducted basic validations as specified in the assignment.

3. **Basic Validations:**
   - All input fields must be filled.
   - Age must be between 18 and 65 years.
   - Gender should be specified by the user.
   - Contact number must consist of 10 digits.
   - Fees should be exactly equal to 500.
   - User must select a slot to make the payment.

4. **Future Enhancements:**
   - Adding a payment method to accept payments through UPI or cards would make this project ready for real-world use.
